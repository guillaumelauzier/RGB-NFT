# RGB-NFT

To code an NFT on the Bitcoin blockchain using the RGB protocol, you will need to follow these general steps:

1. Set up a Bitcoin node: To develop NFTs on Bitcoin, you will need to run a full Bitcoin node on your computer. This will allow you to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain and create new tokens using the RGB protocol.
2. Install the RGB software: RGB is a software implementation of the RGB protocol. You will need to install this software on your computer in order to create new tokens.
3. Write an asset definition: Once you have RGB installed and running, you can write an asset definition for the NFT token. This definition specifies the properties of the token, such as the name, symbol, and total supply, as well as any additional metadata.
4. Issue the token: After you have created the asset definition, you can issue the new token on the Bitcoin blockchain using the RGB software. This will create a new transaction on the blockchain that includes the details of the new token.
5. Manage the token: Once the token has been issued, you can manage it using the RGB software. This allows you to transfer tokens, check the balance of a particular address, and perform other actions related to the token.

# src.py

This code connects to the Bitcoin RPC interface and defines a new NFT asset called "MyNFT" with a symbol of "NFT" and some metadata. It then registers the new asset definition with the RGB software and issues the new asset on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Keep in mind that developing NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain can be more complex and challenging compared to other blockchain platforms, so it's important to have a deep understanding of the technology and ecosystem before getting started.
